# BreakoutGame
Simple game developed using https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/pixie library developed by Mattias Gustavsson

Due to technological error cant upload the full code. You can execute the .exe file and run the game and explore the breakout.cpp file for the game logics. That file contain all the code for the game.
Get the pixie files from above git repo and ask any questions from Mattias. Very helpful and ready to help everyone. 

Also used tiny.c header file for collision detection. you can find that header file in this repo
